This is Training.


A Puzzle game I created while doing my Game Dev Course
This game was quite an adventure, creating complex puzzles and trying to think about what would be tricky for the player
without being obvious is quite an experience, not knowing the experience level of the person playing your game while trying to gauge difficulty
was something new for me, I think I executed on it well.
The Goal was to create a puzzle game with some Animations tied to the camera for a cut scene, to have some challenges and code to open up doors as you collect
keycards or press buttons.



You must Complete your Training.
